# Hotel Appointment Management System

This project is a backend system for managing appointment scheduling, cancellations, and rescheduling for a hotel. It uses Flask, SQLAlchemy, and SQLite to provide a RESTful API for handling appointments.

## Features

- **Appointment Scheduling**: Book new appointments specifying the date.
- **Appointment Cancellation**: Cancel existing appointments.
- **Appointment Rescheduling**: Reschedule existing appointments.
- **Date Range Filtering**: Check for appointment conflicts within a specified date range.

## Technologies

- **Flask**: For creating the API endpoints.
- **Flask-RESTful**: An extension for building REST APIs with Flask.
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database interactions.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database for easy setup.
- **Marshmallow**: For schema validation and serialization.
